<h1>Multi-branch Attention Feature Fusion Network for Person Re-identification</h1>

The innovations of this paper include the following:
<li>We propose a novel Multi-branch Attention Feature Fusion Network (MAFFN) is proposed, which extracts features at different scales through a multi-branch structure and improves robustness by fusing different branch features. </li>
<li>We design a Parallel Attention Module (PAM), which extracts the discriminative information of pedestrians through channel and spatial attention, and the parallel structure both improves the model efficiency and enhances the intercorrelation between features through fusion technique. </li>
<li>Experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets show that MAFFN outperforms the comparative methods and achieves the best level of performance in the three datasets tested. </li>
